**Phonepe Pulse Github Repository Data Extraction and Visualization**
This project aims to extract data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository through scripting and clone it. The extracted data is then transformed into a suitable format and necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps are performed. The transformed data is then inserted into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

A live geo visualization dashboard is created using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner. The data is fetched from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.

The dashboard provides at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
